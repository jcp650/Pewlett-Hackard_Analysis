# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Project Overview

This project seeks to examine hiring needs for soon-to-retire employees at a large tech company. Specifically, analyzing the employee database provided insights into the number of employees expected to retire and the roles which they hold at the company. Further, identifying experienced employees who are eligible to mentor incoming hires will ease the transition of employee turnover. Overall, this project provides key decision makers with the ability to forecast hiring needs and training resources needed to adjust to the large number of retiring employees. 

## Results

Four key points produced from this analysis are as follows:

1.  When filtering the employee database for the age of retiring employees, it appeared that 133,776 employees were of retirement age.
2.  After further analysis, this number was higher beacause of duplicate titles causing duplicate employee listings. The actual number is 90,398 retirement age employees.
3.  The position title breakdown of retiring employees is displayed in figure 1. Hiring engineers should be prioritized.
